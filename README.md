- 👋 Hi, I’m @DroversDuck and I'm an old bloke who's trying to keep up-to-date in this changing, interesting world.
- 👀 I’m using linux (Ubuntu) for my many workshop projects that often cause me to struggle with the linux system.
- 🌱 I’m currently feeling my way with GITHUB because of the access it offers to smarter people's work.
- 💞️ Right now I’m trying to fix a problem with the wireless adapter connected to my Ubuntu desktop.  It's a small problem, I know.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
